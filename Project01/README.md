# Molecular-Geometry-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to introduce you to fundamental Python
programming techniques in the context of a scientific problem, namely
the calculation of the internal coordinates (bond lengths, bond
angles, dihedral angles), moments of inertia, and rotational constants
of a polyatomic molecule.

## Part 1: Read the Coordinate Data from Input

The input to the program is the set of Cartesian coordinates of the
atoms (in bohr) and their associated atomic numbers. A sample molecule
(acetaldehyde) to use as input to the program is:

```
7
6  0.000000000000     0.000000000000     0.000000000000
6  0.000000000000     0.000000000000     2.845112131228
8  1.899115961744     0.000000000000     4.139062527233
1 -1.894048308506     0.000000000000     3.747688672216
1  1.942500819960     0.000000000000    -0.701145981971
1 -1.007295466862    -1.669971842687    -0.705916966833
1 -1.007295466862     1.669971842687    -0.705916966833
```
    
The first line is the number of atoms, while the remaining lines
contain the Z-values (atomic charge) and x-, y-, and z-coordinates of
each atom. This [input file](./input/acetaldehyde.dat) and the other
test cases can be found in this repository in the [input
directory](./input).

Assuming you didn't clone the repository, download the input and
output directories in the form of a
[tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) archive using the command

```
curl -O 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntBre/ProgrammingProjects/master/Project01/files.tar'
```

you can then extract the files using the command

```
tar xvf files.tar
```

You can also copy and paste the files manually from GitHub, but the
`tar` approach will be more convenient when the number of files
increases in later projects.

After somehow getting the files to your computer, you must open the
file, read the data from each line into appropriate variables, and
finally close the file. This sounds pretty straightforward, but it
will introduce us to some important programming constructs. If you
know some Python, give this a shot on your own. Otherwise, expand the
code snippets below and type them into your editor of choice. It may
be tempting to copy and paste, but writing them out by hand will
better help you remember them in the future. We'll break the task into
the steps described above.

## Step 2: Bond Lengths
Calculate the interatomic distances using the expression:

<img src="./figures/distances.png" height="40">

where x, y, and z are Cartesian coordinates and i and j denote atomic indices.

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint2-1.md): Memory allocation
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint2-2.md): Loop structure
- [Hint 3](./hints/hint2-3.md): Printing the results
- [Hint 4](./hints/hint2-4.md): Extending the Molecule class
- [Solution](./hints/step2-solution.md)

## Step 3: Bond Angles
Calculate all possible bond angles. For example, the angle, &phi;<sub>ijk</sub>, between atoms i-j-k, where j is the central atom is given by:

<img src="./figures/bond-angle.png" height="25">

where the e<sub>ij</sub> are unit vectors between the atoms, e.g.,

<img src="./figures/unit-vectors.png" height="30">

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint3-1.md): Memory allocation for the unit vectors
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint3-2.md): Avoiding a divide-by-zero
- [Hint 3](./hints/hint3-3.md): Memory allocation for the bond angles
- [Hint 4](./hints/hint3-4.md): Smart printing
- [Hint 5](./hints/hint3-5.md): Trigonometric functions
- [Solution](./hints/step3-solution.md)

## Step 4: Out-of-Plane Angles
Calculate all possible out-of-plane angles. For example, the angle &theta;<sub>ijkl</sub> for atom i out of the plane containing atoms j-k-l (with k as the central atom, connected to i) is given by:

<img src="./figures/oop-angle.png" height="60">

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint4-1.md): Memory allocation?
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint4-2.md): Cross products
- [Hint 3](./hints/hint4-3.md): Numerical precision
- [Hint 4](./hints/hint4-4.md): Smarter printing
- [Solution](./hints/step4-solution.md)

## Step 5: Torsion/Dihedral Angles
Calculate all possible torsional angles. For example, the torsional angle &tau;<sub>ijkl</sub> for the atom connectivity i-j-k-l is given by:

<img src="./figures/torsion-angle.png" height="60">

Can you also determine the sign of the torsional angle?

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint5-1.md): Memory allocation?
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint5-2.md): Numerical precision
- [Hint 3](./hints/hint5-3.md): Smart printing
- [Hint 4](./hints/hint5-4.md): Sign
- [Solution](./hints/step5-solution.md)

## Step 6: Center-of-Mass Translation
Find the center of mass of the molecule:

<img src="./figures/center-of-mass.png" width="600">

where m<sub>i</sub> is the mass of atom i and the summation runs over all atoms in the molecule.

Translate the input coordinates of the molecule to the center-of-mass.

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint6-1.md): Atomic masses
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint6-2.md): Translating between atomic number and atomic mass
- [Solution](./hints/step6-solution.md)

## Step 7: Principal Moments of Inertia
Calculate elements of the [moment of inertia tensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia_tensor).

Diagonal:

<img src="./figures/inertia-diag.png" width="750">

Off-diagonal (add a negative sign):

<img src="./figures/inertia-off-diag.png" width="600">

Diagonalize the inertia tensor to obtain the principal moments of inertia:

<img src="./figures/principal-mom-of-inertia.png" width="125">

Report the moments of inertia in amu bohr<sup>2</sup>, amu &#8491;<sup>2</sup>, and g cm<sup>2</sup>.

Based on the relative values of the principal moments, determine the [molecular rotor type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_spectroscopy): linear, oblate, prolate, asymmetric.

- [Hint 1](./hints/hint7-1.md): Diagonalization of a 3Ã—3 matrix
- [Hint 2](./hints/hint7-2.md): Physical constants
- [Solution](./hints/step7-solution.md)

## Step 8: Rotational Constants
Compute the rotational constants in cm<sup>-1</sup> and MHz:
